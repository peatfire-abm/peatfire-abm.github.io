## PeatFire Agent-based model

We developed an agent-based model simulating the interactions between human-induced ignitions, fire and peat characteristics that are assumed to be key for tropical peatland burning events. Our results emphasise the risk of a sudden shift of the system from moderate fire occurrence to complete burning. They highlight the importance of peat moisture regulation for peatland fire management.
